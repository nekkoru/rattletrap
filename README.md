# Rattletrap

Rattletrap is a simple IRC bot made from scratch in Python 3 as a training exercise. Although it's designed with Dota 2 irc channels in mind, it can easily be customized to do whatever you want from it. In the future, I plan on decoupling the Dota 2 code from the bot itself so it's easier to customize it for whatever you want to do with it.

This is my first project in Python, so the code quality isn't very good and I've definitely made a ton of rookie mistakes. All constructive comments are welcome.

The IRC bot code is based on the [O'Reilly "Simple Python IRC Client"](http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/h/1968) and the improvements made to it by [Robert Szkutak](https://gist.github.com/RobertSzkutak/1326452). I'm fetching the data from the Dota 2 API using the [dota2api package.](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dota2api).
